# CHRISTMAS ADVENTURE 2019
### An advent calendar art collab for Newgrounds.com mooching off code from the previous year

Open presents everyday leading up to Christmas! https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/743161


Using HaxeFlixel 4.5.1 I think, and probably OpenFl 8.6.4 or above and probably also lime 7.1.1 or above. OpenFL actually needs the latest git version though so that [this](https://github.com/openfl/openfl/pull/2097) works

At least those are the things im using right now.
